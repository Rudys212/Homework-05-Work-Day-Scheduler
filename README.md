## Overview

This project was made to build a day planner where the user is able to enter their tasks for a single work day. The planner is color coded to show the user in which time-block they are currently in. Will also color code the future time-blocks and the past time-blocks. The planner was made using JQuery, Javascript, Bootstrap, CSS and HTML.
